# Defining Our System:-

 Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. The transducer of the sensor acts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo

# SWOT ANALYSIS:-

 ## d) Strength:
The distance to an obstacle can be measured with the low cost ultrasonic sensor . The  sensors can measure distances form 2 to 400cm with an accuracy of 3mm. This sensors module includes ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver and control circuit.


 ## b) Weakness:
Although we fully believe in the capability of our sensors, we understand that ultrasonics are not suited for every application. 
Focuses of low thickness, similar to froth and fabric, have a tendency to assimilate sound vitality; these materials may be hard to sense at long range.


 ## c) Opportunity:
 This project  Can be used as parking assistance systems in vehicles with high power ultrasonic transmitter.
This Project Can be used as burglar alarm with suitable additional 
software for homes and offices.

 ## d) Threats :
Ultrasonic sensors must view a surface (particularly a hard, level surface) unequivocally (oppositely) to get adequate sound reverberation. Additionally, solid detecting requires a base target surface range, which is indicated for every sensor sort.
If connection is wrong there might be chances of short-circuit.

# Test Plan


## Obstacle Detection:
### How: Our implementation for this step requires multiple steps :
#### Step 1: Find a distance value between each pair of sensors. To test the distance
value, we may use the numbers we see for the height and length, as well as the
Pythagorean Theorem.
####Step 2: Check the angle found between each pair of sensors using the distance value
initially found.
####Step 3: Using these values, determine what each angle should approximately be to
detect different types of obstacles.
####Step 4: Detect the obstacles.


## Output: As we had steps for each test, we will again make steps for the expected outputs:
#### Step 1: Compare the outputted (through serial) value for the hypotenuse to the
Pythagorean calculated value. We expect them to be the same.
####  Step 2: Using the same technique as step 1 except calculating the angle, we should
see the same value for this calculation as well.
#### Step 3 : The values and outputs for the “obstacle detected” will be constantly
checked and rechecked to make sure the angles determine the correct obstacle.
#### Step4 : Adding Audio to the Ultrasonic Sensors.

## Testing cases

| Average Speed(m/s)                    | 0.8                           | 1.5    | 2.0    |
| ----------------- | -----------------------|-------------|---------|
| Mean RMS error (cm)* | 19.4  |12.7  |10.2|
|SD** |11.2   |14.3  | 13.4|
|Sensing error (%) | 5.0 | 1.6| 1.0|
|----------------------------------------------------------|


#### RMS error : Root mean square error between actual and sensing distance.
#### SD** : Standard deviation of the RMS errors.

# Communication Protocols
## Wired
#### In this project we use UART communication protocol.
### UART  - TX & RX (2 devices)
* 2 Wire
* Individual clocks used by the both parties
* Standard speed (9600, 115200) - Baud rate
* Parity

## Factors to decide on which communication prototocol to select
### * Frequency :
We need 2oKHz frequency for this project because of this UART is suitable for this model.
### * Data throughput
### * Number of pins available :
There are two pins are avaiable.
#### [1] TX (Pin no 3)
#### [2] RX (Pin no 2).
TX and RX pins we need to display our result .

# Conclusion
The objective of the project was to design and implement an ultrasonic distance meter. The device described here can detect the 
target and calculate the distance of the target. The ultrasonic distance meter is a low cost, low a simple device for distance 
measurement. The device calculates the distance with suitable accuracy and resolution. It is a handy system for non-contact 
measurement of distance. The device has its application in many fields. It can be used in car backing system, automation and 
robotics, detecting the depth of the snow, water level of the tank, production line. This device will also have its application in civil 
and mechanical field for precise and small measurements.
For calculating the distance using this device, the target whose distance is to be measured should always be perpendicular 
to the plane of propagation of the ultrasonic waves. Hence the orientation of the target is a limitation of this system. The ultrasonic 
detection range also depends on the size and position of the target. The bigger is the target, stronger will be the reflected signal 
and more accurate will be the distance calculated. Hence the ultrasonic distance meter is an extremely useful device.
