# Conclusion
The objective of the project was to design and implement an ultrasonic distance meter. The device described here can detect the 
target and calculate the distance of the target. The ultrasonic distance meter is a low cost, low a simple device for distance 
measurement. The device calculates the distance with suitable accuracy and resolution. It is a handy system for non-contact 
measurement of distance. The device has its application in many fields. It can be used in car backing system, automation and 
robotics, detecting the depth of the snow, water level of the tank, production line. This device will also have its application in civil 
and mechanical field for precise and small measurements.
For calculating the distance using this device, the target whose distance is to be measured should always be perpendicular 
to the plane of propagation of the ultrasonic waves. Hence the orientation of the target is a limitation of this system. The ultrasonic 
detection range also depends on the size and position of the target. The bigger is the target, stronger will be the reflected signal 
and more accurate will be the distance calculated. Hence the ultrasonic distance meter is an extremely useful device.
